# QUICK START GUIDE - ESE Policy 4900 Tracking

## 🚀 FIRST TIME SETUP (5 minutes)

### 1. Copy Files to Your Project
Place these 3 files in: `C:\users\rlzim\PycharmProjects\ESE_Policy4900\`
- `task1_process_reports.py`
- `task2_merge_to_master.py`
- `config.json`

### 2. Verify Directories
Make sure these exist (create if needed):
- `C:\BCPS\ESE\Policy4900_Reports_New\`
- `C:\BCPS\ESE\Policy4900_Reports_Master\`

### 3. Test Run
```bash
cd C:\users\rlzim\PycharmProjects\ESE_Policy4900
python task1_process_reports.py
```
Should say "No new reports to process" if no CSV files present.

## 📅 DAILY USE (5-10 minutes)

### When Stephanie Sends Daily Report:

**Step 1:** Save the CSV file
- Name format: `MM-DD-YYYY_Policy4900.csv`
- Example: `10-30-2025_Policy4900.csv`
- Save to: `C:\BCPS\ESE\Policy4900_Reports_New\`

**Step 2:** Process the report
```bash
cd C:\users\rlzim\PycharmProjects\ESE_Policy4900
python task1_process_reports.py
```
✅ Check output - should show classroom counts and approval statuses

**Step 3:** Merge into master
```bash
python task2_merge_to_master.py
```
✅ Check output - look for:
- "Missing - Camera Active" 🚨🚨 (URGENT)
- "Approval Lost" 🚨
- "Approval Gained"

**Step 4:** Open master Excel file
- Path: `C:\BCPS\ESE\Policy4900_Reports_Master\Policy4900_Tracking_Master.xlsx`
- Filter "Change Control" column for alerts
- Update manual columns as needed (Installation Status, Notes, etc.)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ACTIONS

### 🚨🚨 If You See "Missing - Camera Active":
1. Open master Excel file
2. Filter Change Control = "Missing - Camera Active"
3. **Deactivate those cameras IMMEDIATELY**
4. Document in Notes column

### 🚨 If You See "Approval Lost":
1. Open master Excel file
2. Filter Change Control = "Approval Lost"
3. Stop any pending installations
4. Deactivate if camera already active
5. Update Installation Status column

### ✅ If You See "Approval Gained":
1. Open master Excel file
2. Filter Change Control = "Approval Gained"
3. Add to installation queue
4. Note the "Date Added to Installation List" (30-day deadline starts!)

## 📊 KEY COLUMNS IN MASTER FILE

| Column | What It Means | Changes? |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Date First Seen | When we first saw this classroom | Never |
| Change Control | What changed today | Every update |
| Previous Approval Status | Status before today | Every update |
| Approval Status | Current approval status | Daily |
| Date Added to Installation List | When first approved | Never* |
| Installation Status | Your manual tracking | You control |
| Notes | Your comments | You control |

*Never changes even if approval lost then regained

## 🎯 9 CHANGE CONTROL STATUSES

### For Classrooms IN Today's Report:
1. **Added** - Brand new classroom
2. **Approval Gained** - Changed TO approved (100% opt-in)
3. **Approval Lost** - Changed FROM approved (lost approval)
4. **Status Changed** - Other approval change
5. **No Change** - Status stayed same

### For Classrooms NOT IN Today's Report:
6. **Missing - Camera Active** - 🚨🚨 Camera recording but not in report!
7. **Missing - Camera Installed** - Camera installed but not in report
8. **Missing - Was Approved** - Was approved but not in report
9. **Missing - No Camera** - Just not in today's report

## 🔄 WHAT EACH FILE DOES

### Task 1: `task1_process_reports.py`
- Cleans up raw CSV from Stephanie
- Calculates approval statuses
- Handles void classrooms
- Creates `*_PROCESSED.csv` and `.step1` marker
- Does NOT touch master file

### Task 2: `task2_merge_to_master.py`
- Reads all `*_PROCESSED.csv` files (in date order)
- Merges into master Excel file
- Tracks all changes
- Sets Date First Seen
- Sets Date Added to Installation List
- Creates `.step2` marker
- Protects your manual entries

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

**"No new reports found"**
→ Check filename: `MM-DD-YYYY_Policy4900.csv` in Reports_New folder

**"No reports ready for merge"**
→ Run Task 1 first!

**"Master file not found"**
→ Task 2 creates it automatically on first run

**Need to reprocess a date?**
→ Delete the `.step2` marker file for that date, run Task 2 again

**Excel file corrupt?**
→ Use `fix_excel_file.py` from old scripts

**Need to restore backup?**
→ Use `backup_manager.py` from old scripts

---

## 📞 REMEMBER

- **100% approval required** - Even 1 opt-out = denied
- **30-day installation deadline** - Starts from "Date Added to Installation List"
- **Void overrides everything** - If marked void, stays void
- **Protected columns** - Your manual entries never get overwritten
- **Date First Seen never changes** - Tracks when we first knew about classroom
- **Date Added to Installation List never changes** - Even if approval lost then regained
